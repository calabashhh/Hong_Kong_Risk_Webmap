Hong Kong Driving Risk Map — Phase 1 (README)

This interactive webmap presents the Phase 1 baseline risk model for Hong Kong’s road network.
It visualizes structural and historical risk factors across 33,000+ road segments, using publicly available datasets from the Hong Kong government.

The purpose of Phase 1 is to create a segment-level risk foundation that can later integrate YAS telematics, claims data, and traffic exposure to build a dynamic, multi-factor decision engine.
